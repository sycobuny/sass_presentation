Sass!

Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love CSS
-----------------------------------------------

This repo holds various information used to build my presentation on SASS.
It's just a quick intro meant for a 20-minute spot, and was originally given
at a [Baltimore.pm][bpm] meetup in March 2012. It will be presented again at
the inaugural [DC/Baltimore Perl Workshop][dcbpw] in April 2012.

* See [The Sass Website][sass] for more on Sass.
* See [my talk page][talk] on the DCBPW site.
